Project overview- This project is to make a program that tkaes in text files containing temperatures of cores in a cpu and use interpolation on it. 

Progress- This week I've completed piecewise linear interpolation. The program i made is hard coded such a way that it takes data from the txt file that is downloaded from course modules. Further improvements to this program can be that it takes in the file specified by the user and creates a new text file ecerytime it is executed. 

Attachments- The text file from where the data is imported. Input library. Piecewise linear interpolation.py is the code that ive written.
